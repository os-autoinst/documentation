    <p>
    openQA is free software released under the
    <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GPLv2 license</a>. It's
    implemented in <a hef="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> and uses
    <a href="http://www.qemu.org">QEMU</a> (by default) for starting and
    controlling the virtual machines and <a href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a>
    for fuzzy image matching. That means that it should be installable in any
    system with a Perl stack -many modules are required, all of them available
    from <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>-, the OpenCV library and a working
    QEMU, which can be read as "any Linux system".
    <p>

    <p>
    There are two main components in a working openQA installation, both
    available at the corresponding Github repositories:
    <a href="https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst">os-autoinst</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA">openQA</a>. Make sure you
    read the installation guide (also
    <a href="https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA/blob/master/docs/Installing.asciidoc">available
    at Github</a>) before proceeding with the installation.
    </p>

    <p>
    As mentioned in the installation guide, the easiest way to install openQA is
    using the packages available at the openSUSE Build Service. You can find them
    in the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/devel:openQA">openQA
    repository</a>. Latest development version can be found as well in the
    <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/devel:openQA:devel">openQA:devel
    repository</a>. Installation on openSUSE is therefore pretty simple. Refer
    to the above-mentioned guide for details.
