    <p>
    openQA was originally developed by Bernhard M. Wiedemann
    &lt;bernhard+osautoinst ät lsmod de&gt; with contributions from Dominik
    Heidler &lt;dheidler ät suse de&gt;. Both are still very active and
    prominent members of the openQA community, but the development effort is
    nowadays shared with many other hands coordinated by means of a
    <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/openqav3">project in the
    openSUSE's project management tool</a>. That's the best place to take a look
    at the roadmap and the development progress, as well as the best place to
    report bugs or reach the developers in general.

    If you are looking for help, the best place to ask is the
    <a href="irc://irc.opensuse.org/openSUSE-factory">#openSUSE-factory
    channel</a> at irc.opensuse.org (freenode). Everyday openQA development is
    discussed there. It's probably also a good idea to subscribe to the
    <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/">opensuse-factory
    mailing list</a>, even if not all traffic in that list is related to
    openQA. Some old topics can also be found in the former
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/os-autoinst">google group</a>, not
    very active nowadays with most action moved to the above-mentioned irc
    channel and mailing list.
